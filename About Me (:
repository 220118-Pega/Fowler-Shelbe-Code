25. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia.

Bachelors of Science in Biology Pre-Med and minored in Computer Science at Georgia Southern University. In undergrad, I studied Bioinformatics and learned how to complete Multiple Sequence Alignments to prove inheritance on Python by comparing Amino Acid Sequences from different organisms.

I moved to Cleveland in 2020 for Medical school, and I decided to change career pathways due to the pandemic and need for financial freedom. I will miss my white coat, but I'm excited for this new adventure (:
