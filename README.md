# Fowler-Shelbe-Code 
25. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia.
Bachelors of Science in Biology Pre-Med and minor in Computer Science at Georgia Southern University May 2020. In undergrad, I studied Bioinformatics and learned how to complete Multiple Sequence Alignments to prove inheritance on Python by comparing Amino Acid Sequences from different organisms.
I moved to Cleveland in August 2020 for Medical school, and I decided to change career pathways due to the pandemic and need for financial freedom. I will miss my white coat, but I'm excited for this new adventure (:
